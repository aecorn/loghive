# loghive
Logging for beehives, queens, beekeepers, a yearly calendar and more.

A way for me to learn OOP, might grow into something...
Might have a very Norwegian angle at times.

Further ideas:
- App on phone using Kivy
- Google Maps API for placing yards
- Automatic report to Mattilsynet after creating Yard?
- Hive-weights / reports into app?
- Weather report correlated with weights?
